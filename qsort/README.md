# QuickSort

## Functions

* Store 50 16-bit (`dw`) integers in array `a`

* Use quick sort (partition and recursion method) to sort the integers in the same address in ascending order (minimum to maximum)

* Practice basic assembly coding and address management

## Features

* Try to implement with least memory usage as possible

* Use jump instead of loop for better performance

* List out functions of every registers used in segments

* Provide a C++ program for reference, corresponding C++ lines are marked in masm codes

## Notes

* Use `DEBUG -d` and `-t` commands to see the content of `a` before and after sorting

* Use different `a` values to see results, change `n` for different sorting integer number
